# Sample raw dataset

This repo contains a simple raw dataset sample.

The easiest way to load the sample for analyses is as follow:

``` python
  import pandas as pd
  df=pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JattievdLinde/insights/main/data/Data.log')
  df.head()
```

## Basic Analyses

Create a Jupyter notebook, load the dataset and analyse the data, dicuss what is usefull and what not. Look for interesting deviations and how to enhance and extract those for further potenyial processing using machinelearning for example.
